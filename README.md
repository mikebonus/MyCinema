This is a movie-data fetching application [Work in Progress]. 
The entire source code is fully commented for anyone interested in reviewing. 
The source is code based on Mitch Tabian's REST-API lecture on Food Application using REST-API  
in the link below. 

I used to be a subscribed user of his course on his website (https://codingwithmitch.com/) 
and used his source code to build my own version of REST-API app through <b>https://www.themoviedb.org/</b>. 
Based on his source code, everything has been redesigned/reimplemented by myself.

I used Retrofit/GSON to fetch and retrieve to and from the remote data source <b>(https://www.themoviedb.org)</b>
